# SIM and CNIC Utility

This Python script provides utility functions for working with SIM card and CNIC (Computerized National Identity Card) data. It allows you to validate phone numbers and CNIC numbers, as well as retrieve information related to SIM cards and CNIC details.

## Features

- Phone Number Validation: Check if a phone number is valid.
- SIM Database Lookup: Retrieve data associated with a phone number.
- CNIC Validation: Validate the format of a CNIC number.
- CNIC Details Retrieval: Get information related to a CNIC number.

## Dependencies

The script relies on the following dependencies:

- `sim_utils` module: Provides functions for phone number validation and SIM database lookup.
- `cnic_utils` module: Contains functions for CNIC validation and CNIC details retrieval.
- `stringcolor` module: Allows for color formatting of console output.
- `sys` module: Provides access to command-line arguments.

## Usage

To use the SIM and CNIC utility script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/E4crypt3d/SimDatabase.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd SimDatabase
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the script by providing the appropriate command-line arguments:

```
python main.py -n <phone_number>
```

or

```
python main.py -c <cnic_id>
```

Replace `<phone_number>` with the phone number you want to validate or retrieve SIM card data for, and `<cnic_id>` with the CNIC number you want to validate or retrieve details for.

**Note:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions and access rights to retrieve SIM and CNIC data.

## Example Usage

Here are a few examples of how to use the script:

- Retrieve SIM card data:

```
python main.py -n 1234567890
```

- Retrieve CNIC details:

```
python main.py -c 1234567890123
```
